# Simulations for: Impulsivity and self-control as timeless concepts

## Description
Here we provide the code for the simulations used to create the figures in 
the manuscript. The two figures illustrate two delay discounting models, 
namely, the discounted utility model and the hyperbolic discounting model.
The first figure illustrates the difference between the two models, and the
second figure illustrates how the hyperbolic model can be fit to data generated
by the discounted utility model with reasonable fit. In this demonstration, 
it is also supposed to be clear that the hyperbolic discounting model does not
have an 'impulsivity parameter' - the degree of convexity of the hyperbolic
discount function scales with the steepness of it.


## Installation
### Requirements
R 4.0.5 RStudio

### Instructions
Please download the entire folder to your computer. Then, navigate to the folder 
and click on the file called "simulations_timeless-concepts.Rproj". The project 
should open in RStudio with the environment pre-loaded.

The package management for this project was made using 'renv'. This means that 
when you run the following command, all the packages with the correct versions 
will be loaded.

renv::restore()

## Usage
To use this project, run the entire simulations_timeless-concepts.Rmd
